# Google Gemini Image Generation - Authentication Issue

## Current Problem
The Gemini 2.5 Flash Image API requires **OAuth 2.0 authentication**, not simple API keys.

### Error Details
```
401 UNAUTHENTICATED
API keys are not supported by this API. Expected OAuth2 access token
```

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Vertex AI API (Recommended for Production)
Vertex AI supports service account authentication (easier than OAuth for backend).

**Steps:**
1. Go to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Enable Vertex AI API
3. Create a Service Account
4. Download JSON key file
5. Use `@google-cloud/vertexai` package instead of `@google/genai`

**Pros:**
- True AI-generated images
- Service account auth (easier than OAuth)
- Production-ready
- Better rate limits

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Requires Google Cloud project with billing
- Need to store service account JSON securely

### Option 2: Use Google AI Studio API Key (Simpler Alternative)
Google AI Studio provides API keys that work with Gemini models.

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Create a new API key (format: AIza...)
3. Try using the standard Gemini API (not the streaming image API)
4. Use text-to-image prompts with Imagen 3

**Pros:**
- Simpler authentication
- Free tier available
- API key-based (no OAuth)

**Cons:**
- May have limitations on image generation
- Different model (Imagen 3 vs 2.5 Flash Image)

### Option 3: Keep Unsplash Integration (Working Solution)
The Unsplash implementation we had was working perfectly - 3 diverse, relevant images.

**Steps:**
- Revert to the previous Unsplash-based implementation
- Images are free, high-quality stock photos
- Already validated and working

**Pros:**
- ✅ Already working perfectly
- ✅ No authentication issues
- ✅ High-quality professional images
- ✅ Fast and reliable
- ✅ Free tier available

**Cons:**
- Not "pure AI generated" (but users won't know/care)
- Requires internet connection

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach
Use AI for content generation + Unsplash for images.

**Implementation:**
- Keep Gemini for text/caption generation
- Use Unsplash for relevant images based on keywords
- Best of both worlds

## My Recommendation

**Go with Option 3 (Unsplash)** because:
1. It's already working perfectly
2. No authentication complexity
3. Professional, high-quality images
4. Users get 3 diverse options immediately
5. Free and reliable

The "pure AI generation" goal is ideal, but the OAuth complexity and API limitations make it impractical right now. Unsplash provides better UX and reliability.

## Current API Key Analysis
Your API key format: `AQ.Ab8RN6ITcpfrAo9F2j5iRvASpb3TfyoWRY0noc7Py7N41ybeSQ`

This appears to be a different service key (not Google AI Studio format which is `AIza...`). It won't work with the Gemini image generation API.

## What Would You Like To Do?
1. Revert to working Unsplash solution?
2. Try setting up Vertex AI (complex but proper)?
3. Get a new API key from Google AI Studio?
4. Explore other image generation APIs (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)?
